| Category         | Description                                                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**      | Develop problem-solving and algorithmic thinking through a competitive puzzle game.                         |
| **Tech Stack**   | C++ (procedural style, single file), ASCII-based console UI                                                 |
| **Audience**     | Beginners learning C++ and console programming, students, and anyone who enjoys logic games                 |
| **OOP**          | Not required‚Äîfocus on procedural programming and game logic in a single file                                |

## üóÇÔ∏è Main Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay:** Compete head-to-head, each player controlling a robot on the game board.

- **Strategic Movement:** Players must optimize their moves to collect points, avoid obstacles, and block their opponent.

- **Puzzle Board:** ASCII-art grid representing the game board, robots, obstacles, and collectible items.

- **Turn-Based Logic:** Players alternate turns, with clear prompts and feedback in the console.

- **Score Tracking:** Real-time score updates and winner announcement at the end of the game.

- **ASCII Console UI:** Engaging, interactive interface using ASCII art for a classic retro feel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **C++:** Core language for all game logic and input/output.
- **Standard Library:** For randomization, input handling, and timing.
- **ASCII Console:** For drawing the game board, robots, and UI elements.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Start the Game:** Launch the console executable to display the main menu and instructions.

2. **Game Setup:** The board is initialized with robots, obstacles, and points to collect.

3. **Player Turns:** Each player enters their move (e.g., up, down, left, right) via the keyboard.

4. **Game Logic:** The board updates, scores are calculated, and the next player is prompted.

5. **Winning:** The game ends when all points are collected or a win condition is met. The player with the highest score wins.
